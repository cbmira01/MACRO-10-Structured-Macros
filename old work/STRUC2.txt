 
    STRUC2 -- A SET OF STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING MACROS FOR DECSYSTEM-10 ASSEMBLER.
            by Calvin Miracle, Louisville KY


    ABSTRACT

        STRUC2 was developed to allow a programmer working in DecSystem-10 macro
        assembler an easier way to express code. In particular, it was developed
        to allow me to better build a command-string recognizer for another 
        assembler project. STRUC2 was designed to have as little impact as 
        possible on user code. STRUC2 does not use the user's stack. When STRUC2 
        requires working registers, it protects user register values.


    THE MACRO CALLS

        $STRUC 
            Use $STRUC before any use of structured programming macro calls. 
            $STRUC prepares the macro assembly workspace and supplies code for 
            conditional expression evaluation.

        $IF (condition)
          -- code body --
        $ELSE
          -- code body --
        $ENDIF

        $IF (condition) 
          -- code body --
        $ENDIF
            $IF-$ENDIF and $IF-$ELSE-$ENDIF provides for execution of a code 
            body, or an alternate code body, based on a condition.

        $WHILE (condition)
          -- code body --
        $ENDWHILE
            $WHILE-$ENDWHILE loops over a code body while condition is true. Set
            condition TRUE for an infinite loop. Any number of $BREAKs and 
            $CONTINUEs can be used inside the loop.

        $REPEAT
          -- code body --
        $UNTIL (condition)
            $REPEAT-$UNTIL loops over a code body until condition is true. Set 
            condition FALSE for an infinite loop. Any number of $BREAKs and 
            $CONTINUEs can be used inside the loop.

       $FOR (loop_variable,start,(condition),increment)
           -- code body --
       $ENDFOR
            $FOR-$ENDFOR loops over a code body depending on an initial value, a 
            condition, and an increment value. The loop variable must be supplied 
            in user code; it is not defined by the loop structure, nor protected 
            by it. Any number of $BREAKs and $CONTINUEs can be used inside the 
            loop.

        $CASE
            -- code body --
           $WHEN (condition) 
                -- code body --
           $WHEN (condition) 
                -- code body --
           $DEFAULT
                -- code body --
        $ENDCASE
            $CASE-$ENDCASE provides for multi-way execution of code. Code 
            immediately following $CASE is always executed. When a $WHEN 
            condition evaluates true, its code body is executed then a branch 
            is taken to $ENDCASE; code execution does not "fall through" to the 
            following $WHEN. Any number of $WHEN clauses can be defined. The 
            $DEFAULT clause is optional; but if defined, may only be defined 
            once as the final clause in the structure, and must follow at least 
            one $WHEN clause. The $DEFAULT clause will execute if no other $WHEN 
            conditions match. 

        $BREAK (condition)
        $CONTINUE (condition)
            $BREAK and $CONTINUE are legal only in the scope of $WHILE, $REPEAT 
            or $FOR loops. On condition resolved true, $BREAK branches to the 
            exit point of the loop; $CONTINUE branches to the loopback point of 
            the loop. $BREAK and $CONTINUE are optional, and can be used multiple 
            times in the scope of a loop structure.


    CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS 

        A well-formed structure condition 'c' which ultimately resolves to TRUE 
        or FALSE may be built as follows:

            c ::=   (TRUE)   |  (FALSE)   |   (A,compareOp,B)  |  (NOT,(c1))  |
                           ((c1),logicalOp,(c2)) 

            compareOp ::=  EQ  |  NE  |  GT   |  LT   |  GE  |  LE

            logicalOp ::= AND  |  OR  |  XOR  |  EQV  |  IMPL  

            A, B ::= general memory locations in user code, or literal 
                        references (such as [9] or [102])

            c1, c2 ::= well-formed structure conditions

        The compareOp operators make full-word comparisons of their arguments.
        The logicalOp operators evaluate as in the following table:
           
                c1      c2      AND     OR      XOR     EQV     IMPL     NOT(c2)
                T       T       T       T       F       T        T        F 
                T       F       F       T       T       F        F        T 
                F       T       F       T       T       F        T  
                F       F       F       F       F       T        T  

        Keep in mind that the STRUC2 macros do not *enforce* well-formedness 
        of conditional expressions, but should provide good results if the
        pattern above is followed. Study the included development code for good 
        examples.


    PROGRAMMING WITH STRUC2

        Successful use of these macro calls mainly involves closing a structure
        properly with its corresponding end part. Assembly will fail at the 
        first occurrence of an improperly closed structure. 

        STRUC2 macro calls do not support 'local variables': all variables are 
        global. Locality of reference is the responsibility of user code. 

        Conditional expressions should be enclosed in parentheses and use 
        balanced parentheses for sub-expressions. Do not use spaces, because 
        the macro calls are sensitive to stray spaces. So use (for example)
                $IF ((A,EQ,B),AND,((NOT,(C,NE,D)),OR,(E,GE,F)))
        instead of
                $IF ((A, EQ, B), AND, ((NOT, (C, NE, D)), OR, (E, GE, F)))

        User code should avoid the use of symbols used by STRUC2, such as the 
        symbols used in the structure stack or other symbols defined in the 
        $STRUC macro. Users are not prevented from calling the primitive macros 
        that implement structure stack operations, but their use should be done 
        with care. 

        Since the RPN engine uses certain registers when evaluating conditional 
        expressions, the memory references of the general registers should be 
        dereferenced to the symbol $$SAVR. For example, a conditional expression
        to compare registers 3 and 5 can be written as:
                
                $IF ($$SAVR+3,EQ,$$SAVR+5)
                    -- code body --
                $ENDIF


    BUILDING AND USING STRUC2

        STRUC2 structured programming macros are assembled into a UNIVERSAL 
        file, then SEARCHed by user code. To assemble STRUC2.MAC, issue the 
        following commands at the monitor:
            .R MACRO
            *STRUCT.MAC
            ^C

        This will produce STRUC2.UNV, structured programming macros ready for 
        use. STRUC2.UNV can be copied to the system UNV: ersatz device for use 
        by all users on the system.

        In the user's application, a SEARCH line should be included in MACRO
        code, along with whatever other UNIVERSAL files are needed for the 
        application, typically:

                SEARCH      JOBDAT, MACTEN, UUOSYM, STRUC2

        For more information on UNIVERSAL files and SEARCHing, refer to 
        [DMARM] page 3-64 and page 3-75ff.

        The $STRUC macro definition has debug feature tests to retain structure 
        stack symbols in the listing file, to force logic evaluations, and to 
        test the conditional expression evaluation stack. STRUC2 must be 
        re-compiled if feature test symbols are altered.

        Several files are provided to study and debug STRUC2 macro calls. In the
        TEST subdirectory, there are MAC files to test simple and nested 
        programming structures, and a file LOGIC.MAC to test simple and nested 
        conditional expressions using all operators. In addition, a file TRUTH.MAC
        implements a realistic example program to output truth tables, and 
        STRING.MAC implements a recognizer for a filespec string.


    THEORY OF OPERATION

        At assembly time, the STRUC2 macros manipulate a 'structure stack' which
        is composed of numbered MACRO-10 assembler symbols; this is distinct from
        the runtime pushdown stack. Structure stack symbols begin on a base 
        symbol '.s' and are numbered in octal from .s0 to .s7777. 

        The structure stack keeps track of 'activations' of structures with 
        'activation codes' so that structures can be nested without interfering 
        with each other, and so that branch resolutions can be applied at the 
        proper invocation level. Activation codes enforce the rules for proper 
        use of structured programming macros.

        Other values residing on the structure stack are forward and backward 
        jumps requiring resolution. If a BREAK is used in a loop, a count of     
        branches requiring forward resolution is pushed onto the structure stack. 
        The symbols .sPtr and .sLim, both defined in the $STRUC macro, are used
        to record the size and current push-level of the structure stack.

        Conditional expressions defined by the user are parsed into a string of 
        reverse-polish notation (RPN) symbols: logical and comparison operators, 
        truth and memory values, and a couple of administrative symbols.
        
        The macro calls make sure that each RPN string is eventually submitted 
        to the 'RPN engine' for evaluation. The RPN strings ultimately evaluate 
        to either 'true' or 'false'.

        The RPN engine is threaded into structure code. When initialized, the 
        RPN engine is told where to find the RPN symbol string and the addresses 
        it should jump to after a 'true' or 'false' result. The RPN engine can 
        detect two runtime error conditions.


    DEVELOPMENT NOTES, WHAT'S NEXT

        It might be interesting (but maybe not worthwhile) to add certain 
        features to make STRUC2 more like a true structured programming language
        such as PASCAL or C. Expression evaluation could be built along the 
        lines of the conditional expression parser and RPN engine; local 
        variables could be pushed onto the structure stack at activation; and 
        procedure calls could made recursive if a runtime activation frame was 
        maintained. Anyone who implements these features is free to name his set 
        of macro defintions "STRUCx", for some value of x greater than 2!

        In a $FOR loop, the start and increment values are actually memory 
        locations, but can be made to appear as literal values by use of the 
        assembler's literal brackets []. For example, a FOR loop to count from 
        0 to 100 by 10 can be set up as: 
                LOOPV:  BLOCK 1
                $FOR (LOOPV,[0],(LOOPV,LE,[100]),[10])
                        -- loop code --
                $ENDFOR

        A nested loop to initialize each cell of a 100x100 array with the 
        product of its indices can be implemented as:
                PRODUCT=1
                INDEX=2
                I:      BLOCK 1
                J:      BLOCK 1
                BASE:   BLOCK 100
                $FOR (I,[0],(I,LE,[9]),[1])
                    $FOR (J,[0],(J,LE,[9]),[1])
                        move    PRODUCT, I
                        imul    PRODUCT, J
                        move    INDEX,I
                        imul    INDEX,[10]
                        add     INDEX,J
                        movem   PRODUCT,BASE(INDEX)
                    $ENDFOR  ; end J
                $ENDFOR   ; end I
