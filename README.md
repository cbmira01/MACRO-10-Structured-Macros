# MACRO-10 STRUCTURED Macros

## More about structured macros for programming assembler
- Robert P. Nix's contribution to the DECUS Program Library
- "Macro Control Structures for Structured Programming in ALC", Connally 1975

## More about TOPS-10 and historical simulation
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPS-10
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMH

## To see it in action
- You must have a working TOPS-10 host with MACRO-10 and LINK-10 support.
- You must have a means to move text files into TOPS-10 (Kermit, for example).
- Copy all files into a TOPS-10 build directory.
- Issue command "DO CLEAN" then "DO BUILD" to yield STRUC2.UNV.
- Issue command "DO TEST" to run tests.

## Status of this implementation
- This project implements all intended programming macros.
- This repo needs cleanup, better documentation, and better tests.
