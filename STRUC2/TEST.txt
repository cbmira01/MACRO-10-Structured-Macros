The MACRO-10 files in this directory...
; This code was used mainly to generate listing files so that STRUC2 structures
;   could be tested during development. The Z opcodes simulate user code.
;   An END statement can be inserted at any point to examine unresolved symbols. 
;   No extensive tests of conditional expressions are done here, other 
;   than to observe that RPN strings are built and that the RPN engine is 
;   assembled and initialized.
;
; This code was used mainly to test the assembly of conditional expressions
;   and to debug a running RPN engine. Z opcodes simulate user code,
;   and execute as nop-ops. The .ftrpn feature test can be used to force a 
;   stack failure.
