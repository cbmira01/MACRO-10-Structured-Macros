    MACRO-10 STRUCTURED MACROS, "STRUC2"

    ABSTRACT

        STRUC2 was developed to allow a programmer an easier way to express 
        code in DECsystem-10 macro assembler. STRUC2 was designed to have as 
        little impact as possible on other code. STRUC2 does not use the user's 
        stack. When STRUC2 requires working registers, it protects user register 
        values. STRUC2 was inspired by Robert P. Nix's 1978 contribution to the
        DECUS Program Library, "DECsystem-10 Structured Prgramming Macros".

    BUILD AND TEST

    THE MACRO CALLS

        $STRUC 

            Use $STRUC before any use of structured programming macro calls. 
            $STRUC prepares the assembly workspace and supplies code for 
            conditional expression evaluation.

        $IF <(condition)>
          {body}
        $ELSE
          {body}
        $ENDIF

        $IF <(condition)>
          {body}
        $ENDIF

            $IF-$ENDIF and $IF-$ELSE-$ENDIF provides for execution of a code 
            body, or an alternate code body, based on a condition.

        $WHILE <(condition)>
          {body}
        $ENDWHILE

            $WHILE-$ENDWHILE loops over a code body while condition is true. 
            Set condition TRUE for an infinite loop. 
            Any number of $BREAKs and $CONTINUEs can be used inside the loop.

        $REPEAT
          {body}
        $UNTIL <(condition)>

            $REPEAT-$UNTIL loops over a code body until condition is true. 
            Set condition FALSE for an infinite loop. 
            Any number of $BREAKs and $CONTINUEs can be used inside the loop.

       $FOR loop_variable, start, <(condition)>, increment
           {body}
       $ENDFOR

            $FOR-$ENDFOR loops over a code body. 
            The loop variable must be supplied; it is not protected in the loop.
            Any number of $BREAKs and $CONTINUEs can be used inside the loop.

        $CASE
            {body}
           $WHEN <(condition)>
                {body}
           $WHEN <(condition)> 
                {body}
           [...additional $WHEN clauses allowed...]
           $DEFAULT
                {body}
        $ENDCASE

            $CASE-$ENDCASE provides for multi-way execution of code. 
            Code immediately following $CASE is always executed. 
            When a $WHEN condition evaluates true, its code body is executed, 
            then a branch is taken to $ENDCASE. 
            Any number of $WHEN clauses can be defined. 
            The $DEFAULT clause is optional; but if defined, may only be defined 
            once as the final clause in the structure, and must follow at least 
            one $WHEN clause. 
            The $DEFAULT clause will execute if no other $WHEN conditions match. 

        $BREAK <(condition)>
        $CONTINUE <(condition)>

            $BREAK and $CONTINUE are legal only in the scope of $WHILE, $REPEAT 
            or $FOR loops. On TRUE, $BREAK branches to the exit point of the loop,
            while $CONTINUE branches to the loopback point of the loop. 
            $BREAK and $CONTINUE are optional and can be used multiple times in 
            the scope of a loop structure.

    CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS 

        A structure condition expression 'c' which ultimately resolves to 
            TRUE or FALSE may be built as follows:

            c ::= (TRUE) | (FALSE) | (A,compareOp,B) | (NOT,(c1)) |
                           ((c1),logicalOp,(c2))

            compareOp ::=  EQ  |  NE  |  GT   |  LT   |  GE  |  LE

            logicalOp ::= AND  |  OR  |  XOR  |  EQV  |  IMPL  

            A, B ::= memory or literal references 

            c1, c2 ::= structure condition expressions

        The compareOp operators make full-word comparisons of their arguments.
        The logicalOp operators are used to finally combine logical results of 
        compareOps, and will evaluate as in the following table:
           
                c1      c2      AND     OR      XOR     EQV     IMPL     NOT(c2)
                T       T       T       T       F       T        T        F 
                T       F       F       T       T       F        F        T 
                F       T       F       T       T       F        T  
                F       F       F       F       F       T        T  

        A conditional expression should be enclosed in left and right angle 
        brackets, as demonstrated in the macro calls section above. 

        Keep in mind that the STRUC2 macros do not *enforce* well-formedness 
        of conditional expressions, but should provide good results if the
        pattern above is followed. Look at the included unit tests for good 
        examples.

    PROGRAMMING WITH STRUC2

        Successful use of these macro calls mainly involves closing a structure
        properly with its corresponding end part. Assembly will fail at the 
        first occurrence of an improperly closed structure. 

        STRUC2 macro calls do not support 'local variables': all variables are 
        global. Locality of reference is the responsibility of user code. 

        Conditional expressions should be enclosed in parentheses, use 
        balanced parentheses for sub-expressions, and be finally enclosed in 
        left and right angle brackets. Do not use spaces, because the macro 
        calls are sensitive to stray spaces. So use (for example)
                $IF <(A,EQ,B)>    instead of   $IF <(A, EQ, B)>

        User code should avoid the use of symbols used by STRUC2, such as the 
        symbols used in the structure stack or other symbols defined in the 
        $STRUC macro. Users are not prevented from calling the primitive macros 
        that implement structure stack operations, but their use should be done 
        with care. 

        Since the RPN engine uses certain general registers when evaluating 
        conditional expressions, memory references to general registers should be 
        dereferenced to the location $$SAVR. For example, a conditional expression
        to compare registers 3 and 5 can be written as:
                
                $IF <($$SAVR+3,EQ,$$SAVR+5)>
                    {body}
                $ENDIF

    BUILDING AND USING STRUC2

        STRUC2 structured programming macros are assembled into a UNIVERSAL 
        file, then SEARCHed by user code. To assemble STRUC2.MAC, issue the 
        following commands at the monitor:
            .R MACRO
            *STRUCT.MAC
            ^C

        This will produce STRUC2.UNV, structured programming macros ready for 
        use. STRUC2.UNV can be copied to the system UNV: ersatz device for use 
        by all users on the system.

        In the user's application, a SEARCH line should be included in MACRO
        code, along with whatever other UNIVERSAL files are needed for the 
        application, typically:

                SEARCH      JOBDAT, MACTEN, UUOSYM, STRUC2

        For more information on UNIVERSAL files and SEARCHing, refer to 
        [DMARM] page 3-64 and page 3-75ff.

        The $STRUC macro definition has debug feature tests to retain structure 
        stack symbols in the listing file, to force logic evaluations, and to 
        test the conditional expression evaluation stack. STRUC2 must be 
        re-compiled if feature test symbols are altered.

        Several files are provided to study and debug STRUC2 macro calls. In the
        TEST subdirectory, there are MACRO-10 files to test simple and nested 
        programming structures, and a file LOGIC.MAC to test simple and nested 
        conditional expressions using all operators. In addition, a file TRUTH.MAC
        implements a realistic example program to output truth tables, and 
        STRING.MAC implements a recognizer for a filespec string.

    THEORY OF OPERATION

        At assembly time, the STRUC2 macros manipulate a 'structure stack' which
        is composed of numbered MACRO-10 assembler symbols; this is distinct from
        the runtime pushdown stack. Structure stack symbols begin on a base 
        symbol '.s' and are numbered in octal from .s0 to .s7777. 

        The structure stack keeps track of 'activations' of structures with 
        'activation codes' so that structures can be nested without interfering 
        with each other, and so that branch resolutions can be applied at the 
        proper invocation level. Activation codes enforce the rules for proper 
        use of structured programming macros.

        Other values residing on the structure stack are forward and backward 
        jumps requiring resolution. If a BREAK is used in a loop, a count of     
        branches requiring forward resolution is pushed onto the structure stack. 
        The symbols .sPtr and .sLim, both defined in the $STRUC macro, are used
        to record the size and current push-level of the structure stack.

        Conditional expressions defined by the user are parsed into a string of 
        reverse-polish notation (RPN) symbols: logical and comparison operators, 
        truth and memory values, and a couple of administrative symbols.
        
        STRUC2 macro calls submit these RPN strings to an 'RPN engine' for 
        evaluation to an overall 'true' or 'false' result. The RPN engine is 
        threaded into structure code. When initialized, the RPN engine is told 
        where to find the RPN string and the addresses it should jump to after 
        evaluating the logical result. The RPN engine can detect a couple of 
        simple runtime error conditions.

    DEVELOPMENT NOTES, WHAT'S NEXT

        Here is an example of a $FOR loop, a count over a code body from 
        I = 0 to 100 stepping by 10, using MACRO-10 literals:

                I:  BLOCK 1
                $FOR I, [0], <(LOOPV,LE,[100])>, [10]
                        {body}
                $ENDFOR

        A nested loop to initialize each cell of a 100x100 array with the 
        product of its indices can be implemented as:

                PRODUCT=1
                INDEX=2
                I:      BLOCK 1
                J:      BLOCK 1
                BASE:   BLOCK 100
                $FOR I, [0], <(I,LE,[9])>, [1]
                    $FOR J, [0], <(J,LE,[9])>, [1]
                        move    PRODUCT, I
                        imul    PRODUCT, J
                        move    INDEX,I
                        imul    INDEX,[10]
                        add     INDEX,J
                        movem   PRODUCT,BASE(INDEX)
                    $ENDFOR  ; end J
                $ENDFOR   ; end I

        It might be interesting (but maybe not worthwhile) to add certain 
        features to make STRUC2 more like a true structured programming language
        such as PASCAL or C. Expression evaluation could be built along the 
        lines of the conditional expression parser and RPN engine; local 
        variables could be pushed onto the structure stack at activation; and 
        procedure calls could made recursive if a runtime activation frame was 
        maintained.
